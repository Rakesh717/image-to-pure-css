This is a simple python script to convert images to pure css (using background colors).

To run this program, make sure you have python and pip installed in your machine (I am using Python 3.8.2 and Pip 20.0.2), then run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt

python main.py [IMAGE_PATH_HERE] # without brackets
```

if you just want to test the script, you can use the test image:
```
python main.py ./test.jpeg
```
